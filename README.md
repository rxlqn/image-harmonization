#### Color Transfer Methods

â€‹    We provide four color transfer methods thanks to the prior work of Wei Xu[[1]](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.205.199&rep=rep1&type=pdf)*. color_transfer_methods.pdf* is provided as well.  It's a document about the color transfer methods taxonomy and details about how to use them to generate composite images.
