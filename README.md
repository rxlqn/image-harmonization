#### Color Transfer Methods

Installation and Usage
- Install [Matlab](http://lic.si.sjtu.edu.cn/).
- Download [Microsoft COCO dataset](http://cocodataset.org/#download) splits (train2014, val2014, train2017, val2017) and corresponding annotations.
- Download and unzip the code. We provide four color transfer methods thanks to the prior work of Wei Xu[[1]](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.205.199&rep=rep1&type=pdf). Additionally, we provide COCO API for Matlab.
- For more detailed usage, you can refer to *color_transfer_methods.pdf*. It's a document about the color transfer methods taxonomy and details about how to use them to generate composite images.
